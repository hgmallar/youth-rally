            Dear Graduates, future Graduates, and potential newcomers to the
            Youth Rally "Family",
          </p>

          <p>
            One of my favorite parts of the Youth Rally is having the
            opportunity to watch our graduates come back as counselors and make
            the transformation from mentee to mentor. Similar is the feeling I
            get observing a first-time Rally counselor (without previous Youth
            Rally experience) assimilate seamlessly into our "Family".
          </p>

          <p>
            Since inception in 2009, the Youth Rally Counselor-in-Training (CIT)
            program has transformed into more of a "Leadership Training" and the
            curriculum in its entirety has had a remarkable impact on the camper
            experience, the attitudes of our volunteer team, and the overall
            success of the Rally as a whole. First time Youth Rally counselors
            (of any age) now get the unique experience of navigating through
            their first year(s) as a counselor as part of this program. Under
            the expert tutelage of hand-selected Youth Rally leaders, our CITs
            learn the importance of mentorship while performing actions that are
            purposeful and meaningful.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is invaluable for our campers to have relevant role models and
            likewise as important for our team of volunteers to be best equipped
            for the journey.
          </p>

          <p>
            Learning, growing, leading; this is what the Youth Rally CIT program
            is about. This is my call to the leaders reading this letterâ€¦ YOU
            ARE WANTED!
          </p>

          <p>All the best,</p>
