            <p>
              Each year the Youth Rally has a dedicated team of Licensed Medical
              Professionals who have experience with wound, ostomy and
              continence nursing (WOCN). Additional members of the Youth Rally
              Medical Team might have experience in pediatrics, trauma, medical,
              or surgical nursing. Some even have ostomies or other
              bowel/bladder diversions themselves!

              {" "}
              Members of the Youth Rally Medical Team recognize the importance
              of skin health, ostomy care, continence, and medication management
              and volunteer their time to support the campers as needed both
              physically and psychosocially. They are very much an extension of
              our counselor team. As such, they also have a number of
              responsibilities throughout the week including:
