                Youth Rally Counselors are adults of all ages (minimum age to
                apply is 19), most of whom live with the same bowel and/or
                bladder conditions as the camper participants. Through their own
                life experiences with medical and surgical challenges,
                counselors and CITs have first-hand knowledge of what the
                campers are or may be facing and can provide the needed support
                to promote self-confidence and independence. They are leaders
                and mentors. Â Many Youth Rally Counselors/CITs were once campers
                themselves.
